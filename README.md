# Historical context

The period between 1970 and 1982 marked a significant shift in the United States car industry. American production shifted from heavy, powerful six- and eight-cylinder cars with poor gas mileage to lighter, less powerful, four-cylinder cars with higher fuel efficiency. The global auto industry–including Americans and their European and Japanese competitors–raised overall miles per gallon (MPG) by focusing on four-cylinder cars and making them more fuel efficient.
